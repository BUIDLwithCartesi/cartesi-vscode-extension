# 🖥️ Interface Overview

The Cartesi VS code Extention provide a user-friendly interface to streamline cartesi Rollup dapp development.

1️⃣ **Working Area - Code Editor**

The main area in the vs code Editor, Where you can write smart contract and dApp configerations.
the extention enhance the experience with:

- Syntax Highlighting:

  - provides colour coded syntax for Cartesi smart contract and Rollup sctipt.
  - Support Python, Java script, Rust and other programing languages
  - Highlights Cartesi-Specfic Keywords, functions and contract stractures.

- Autocomplete & Intellisense

  - smart suggestions for Cartesi Rollup APIs and functions.
  - Hover tooltips provide inline documentation for cartesi commands.
  - Bracket matching & auto-closing to avoid syntax errors.

- Code Snippets for Faster Development

Use predefined Cartesi snippets to quickly insert common patterns

Example Snippet - Initializing a cartesi Machine.

Type **cartesi-machine** and select the snippet to insert:

    cartesi_machine = cartesimachine {
        memory_size = 1024 + 1024 + 512, --512MB RAM
        bootargs = "console=tty50 root=/dev/vda1",
        rom = "/opt/cartesi/rom.bin"
    }

- Automatically fills in default Cartesi Machine Parameters.

- Snippets available for stateful execution, transaction handling and Rollup verification.

2️⃣ **Sidebar: Navigation**

Acsses the cartesi Sidebar from the Activity Bar (View -> Cartesi). The Sidebar provides a stractured workflow for Rollup Development to organize and navigate your dapp project.

- Project Explorer - View and manage smart contract and script.

- Quick Actions
- Buttons for common tasks:
  - Intialize a cartesi dApp
  - Build & Deploy Smart Contract
  - Simulate Transactions
  - View Execution Logs

3️⃣ **Integrated development Tools**
